# VEX Team 2019B Source Code 2017-18

Source code for VEX Team 2019B for the 2017-18 year, for the "In the Zone" challenge. This source code was used by VEX Team 2019B to advance to the World Championship, and place Top 50 in the World for the Autonomous Robot Skills Challenge. This repository includes source code for three different robots - a skills, competition, and worlds robot. 

# Using this Codebase

This repository contains code for three different robots - in chronological order, the folder labeled "old" was the oldest, followed by "skills," "competition," and finally, "worlds." Although the code is exclusive to these robots, the general principles, such as the PID loops and motor distributions are able to be used from this heavily commented codebase.
